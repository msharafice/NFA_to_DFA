# NFA to DFA

## Project Description
The "NFA to DFA" project is designed to convert a Non-deterministic Finite Automaton (NFA) into a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA). The conversion process ensures that the NFA, which can have multiple possible transitions for a given input, is transformed into a DFA, which has only one transition for each input symbol from each state. This project allows for a clear understanding of how non-deterministic machines can be represented deterministically.

## Features
- Converts NFA to DFA step-by-step.
- Handles NFA with multiple states and input symbols.
- Provides a detailed breakdown of the conversion process.
- Generates the corresponding DFA based on the input NFA.
- Compatible with various types of input strings and NFA configurations.
